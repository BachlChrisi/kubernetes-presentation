# Kubernetes is awesome!

## Overview

This is a template-project for my presentation in December. It contains my realjs presentation and also a simple example with quarkus.

## Requirements

To try out my quarkus-kubernetes example you need an available kubernetes cluster. Also you need docker to create an image of the quarkus application. If you want to add some code you need to install maven. I used also the openjdk11.

## Option 1: Kubernetes scripts for the presentation

Because it would take a year to write all commands by my self i created a little cheatsheet for myself. It contains in particlar all the workflow to set up a kubernetes cluster from scratch.

## Option 2: Start the quarkus example

For my example i builed a simple rest api with quarkus. It contains some basic endpoints that will return you some fake data (Topic is at the moment unsure).

## Deploy the application to your kubernetes cluster
